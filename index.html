    <h1>Dear Riyadh,</h1>
    <p class="apology">
      I still remember that day — we laughed, played, and shared moments as friends. <br><br>
      But I made one mistake... I asked a question that may have crossed a line, a question I never intended to offend with. <br><br>
      Since that moment, the silence between us has grown louder than any words. And honestly, it hurts. <br><br>
      If I could take it back, I would. Not because of the words — but because of the distance it caused. 
      <br><br>
      You mattered to me more than that moment ever will. And you still do.
    </p>
